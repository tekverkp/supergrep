# Supergrep

Supergrep is a web based log streamer written in node

## Getting Started

You can edit variables in localConfig.js and also in static/js/supergrep.js. Most of this should work out of the box but some of the cooler functionality is enabled by assuming certain pieces of data can be found in your logs.  You'll have to adjust the regexes to suit your logs.

Then you can install the node packages:

    $ node install

Run it:

    $ runlocal
